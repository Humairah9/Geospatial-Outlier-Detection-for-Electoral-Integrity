# Geospatial-Outlier-Detection-for-Electoral-Integrity
Analyzed Kwara State election data using Python and Tableau to detect voting anomalies. Applied clustering (DBSCAN) and anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, Moranâ€™s I, Getis-Ord Gi) to flag outlier polling units and visualize spatial patterns that support electoral transparency.
